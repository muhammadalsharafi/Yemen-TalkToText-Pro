# TalkToText Pro - AI Meeting Summarizer

This project, **TalkToText Pro**, is an AI-powered pipeline designed to process meeting recordings (audio or video), transcribe them, and generate a structured, actionable summary compliant with the SRS document.

---

## Core Features

- **End-to-End Automated Pipeline**
  Seamless workflow from media upload (file or URL) to a structured, final summary, managed via an intuitive web interface.

- **State-of-the-Art Accuracy & Speed**
  Optimal balance of performance by leveraging a multi-model AI stack, ensuring both world-class accuracy and efficient processing.

- **Intelligent Content Pre-Screening**
  Lightweight AI model (`gpt-5-nano`) analyzes metadata and audio snippets, automatically filtering irrelevant content before full processing.

- **Advanced Audio Engineering**
  Uses **FFmpeg** for robust audio processing, including format standardization, quality enhancement filters, and silence removal.

- **Precision Transcription**
  Employs OpenAI's **Whisper-1** model for highly accurate speech-to-text conversion across accents and domains.

- **Multi-Language Support**
  Detects the source language and translates to English using **gpt-5-mini** when needed.

- **SRS-Compliant Summarization**
  Uses **gpt-5** with a carefully engineered prompt to produce structured summaries:
  - Abstract
  - Key Points
  - Action Items
  - Decisions
  - Sentiment Analysis

- **Robust Backend Architecture**
  Built on **OOP principles** for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

- **Persistent Job & User Management**
  Integrates with **MongoDB** for secure user and job tracking.

## Technical Architecture & Design

### OOP Structure
- **Encapsulation**: Each functionality is within its own class (`AudioProcessor`, `TextProcessor`, `AIServices`, `DatabaseManager`).
- **Orchestration**: `MainPipeline` manages interaction between components.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Dedicated exceptions (`FileSystemError`, `FFmpegError`, `ApiServiceError`) for precise error handling.

### Multi-Model AI Strategy
- `whisper-1`: For transcription
- `gpt-5-nano`: For pre-screening/classification
- `gpt-5-mini`: For translation
- `gpt-5`: For final structured summarization

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python
Install **Python 3.8+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Check version:
```bash
python --version
```

### 2. FFmpeg

**System-Wide Installation**

- **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg official](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), extract, and add to PATH.
- **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`

**Verify:**
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

**Portable Installation (Bundled)**

Download from [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). Extract and copy `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` into `bin/` inside the project folder.

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Project Files
Place project files in a folder (e.g., `AI_Project`).

### Step 2: Virtual Environment
```bash
cd path/to/AI_Project
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate:**
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

### Step 4: OpenAI API Key
In `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-secret-key
```

### Step 5: MongoDB Connection
In `.env` file:
```
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/mydatabase"
```

---

## How to Run

### Option 1: Web Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Open in browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Option 2: Command-Line Script
Edit `main.py`:
```python
input_source = r"C:\path\to\your\meeting.mp4"
```

(Optional) edit `config.py`:
```python
SELECTED_AUDIO_QUALITY = "medium"
```

Run:
```bash
python "main.py"
```

Results are stored in MongoDB.
